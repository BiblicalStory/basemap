The universe does not rest. It trembles. Every symmetry that breaks creates a ripple — a motion that did not exist before. From the earliest configurations of energy, imbalance was the catalyst. Because things were not evenly distributed, they moved. And from that movement came temperature, structure, gravity, entropy. Motion is not a flaw in the system — it is what the system becomes when it is not at rest.

This is the architecture of reality: where there is tension, there is form. A stretched surface gives rise to vibration. A mass in space causes curvature. Two particles, out of sync, create interference. The cosmos is a grammar of difference — and difference is what drives it forward. The laws we’ve found are not laws of stasis. They are laws of interaction, drift, instability.

We do not control this. We inhabit it. Our bodies are born into it. Our thoughts ride the currents of neurons shaped by it. We do not know where it leads. But we know that it moves — always, everywhere — because the world is not even. And that unevenness, strangely, is what gives it life.
