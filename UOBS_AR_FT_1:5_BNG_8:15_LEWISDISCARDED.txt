The spheres still turn, unwearied. Though mortal eyes falter and human ears fall deaf, the heavens have not ceased their great procession. Beyond the reach of sight and grasp, the singing intelligences move: in endless brightness, in measured joy, in covenantal festivity. Their courses trace the memory of creation’s first delight, unmarred by the forgetting below. Every unseen order, every silent choir, remains faithful to the music set before the worlds were spun. They do not falter in their joy; they have not ceased from their liturgy.

Here in the high and hidden places, Being itself is celebration. There is no fracture here, no crumbling pillar nor lost foundation. The architecture of existence hums with an unbroken vow, each layer bearing its measure of the divine gift. The firmament’s breath, the hierarchies of wisdom, the swift fires of the unseen — all still whirl in their appointed songs, bearing witness to a covenant deeper than decay. What is called forgotten in the low world has never been forgotten here. It burns, it dances, it waits.

Thus the fulfillment begins not with repair, but with revelation. To open the eyes of the blind is not to mend the stars; it is to see again the stars’ unbroken dance. To awaken human hearts is not to restore the heavens, but to rejoin the joy they never ceased to bear. The unseen city stands already: its walls unfallen, its gates unbroken, its towers alight with festal fire. It is not built by mortal hands — it was never abandoned. It waits, patient and singing, for the great joining that will gather heaven and earth back into one breathing song.
