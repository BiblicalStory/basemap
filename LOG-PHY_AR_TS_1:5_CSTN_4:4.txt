The stability we observe is never absolute. Every orbit precesses. Every spin drifts. What we call equilibrium is only a temporary agreement between competing forces — a negotiation, not a resolution. Over time, that agreement begins to fray. The electron cloud destabilizes under heat. The star’s fusion can no longer counteract gravity. Entropy rises, not as chaos, but as a quiet insistence: even what holds, loosens.

In the largest systems — galaxies, clusters, the fabric of space itself — we find echoes of this drift. Constants do not vary, but their effects accumulate. The geometry of spacetime remains smooth, yet curvature begets collapse. The universe, expanding, cools and fragments. Its motion slows, but it does not rest. If it ever was still, it is no longer.

This is not decay. It is continuation. But it is a tensed continuation — a movement that reveals the limits of structure. The more complex the form, the more ways it can unravel. The universe remains elegant. But its elegance now carries strain.
