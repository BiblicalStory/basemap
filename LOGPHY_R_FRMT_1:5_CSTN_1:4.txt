There is no reason to believe that the story of creation ends with the laws we now know. Physics has always advanced by recognizing that what we once called final was in fact preparation. What if the deepest truths of reality are not in what persists, but in what is transformed? Not in symmetry alone, but in resurrection?

The resurrection of Christ is not a suspension of physical law. It is its recomposition — the unveiling of what the world has been becoming all along. It shows that matter is not closed, that the universe is not condemned to entropy alone. In the risen Christ, we see the firstfruits of a new creation, where the intelligibility of the world is not erased but glorified.

This does not mean physics ends. It means physics becomes worship. To speak of gravity or quantum uncertainty or biological emergence is not to speak of futility — but of a cosmos reoriented. Motion now carries meaning. Law is now the language of love. The world is not discarded. It is reborn — and those who study its structure are the stewards of its song.
