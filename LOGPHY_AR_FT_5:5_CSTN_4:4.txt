There will come a time when nothing remains to be said. The particles will have moved. The stars will have burned. Every field will have interacted. Every tension will have dissipated. What was folded will have unfolded. What was coiled will have slackened. There will be no more gradients, no more asymmetry, no more flow. Only the quiet — complete, uniform, and whole.

It will not be cold. Not in the way we think of it. It will not be dark. There will be no eyes to see. The laws will still hold, but they will no longer have anything to move. The music of the cosmos will have ended — not with a note, but with the slow fading of resonance into rest.

This is not the failure of the universe. It is its conclusion. A story told without voice. A choreography that danced itself to silence. It does not ask us to mourn it. But for those of us who were awake to its motion, its echo may linger as a kind of question. A form so perfect it no longer moves. A world finished, and yet still beautiful.
