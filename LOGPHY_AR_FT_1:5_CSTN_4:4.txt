The world is intelligible not because of chance, but because it is the creation of a rational Mind. Its order is not imposed; it is spoken. The laws we study are not the residue of chaos, but the echoes of a Word. To do physics is to trace the logic of that utterance — not to possess it, but to follow it, faithfully, questioningly, reverently.

The beauty we find in equations is not arbitrary. The fine-tuning of constants, the coherence of structures, the generative asymmetries — these are not just elegant; they are gifts. And though we do not hear the voice that called them forth with instruments or sensors, we recognize in their patterned silence the grammar of meaning. Reality is not mute. It is articulate.

Here, at the beginning of response, the physicist becomes a worshiper. Not because the science has failed, but because it has led to the threshold — the point at which explanation gives way to awe, and awe gives birth to trust. The universe is not merely intelligible. It is invitational.
