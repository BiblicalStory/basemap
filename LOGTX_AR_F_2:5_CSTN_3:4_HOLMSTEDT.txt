Before there is interpretation, there is grammar. Not the grammar we impose — but the grammar that is already there, ancient and deliberate, woven into the Hebrew text. And this grammar is not neutral. It is a system of cues, constraints, and conceptual rhythms that structure what can be said — and how it is meant to be received.

The Hebrew verb system does not mirror English time. It arranges events relationally, shaping causation through sequence and clause hierarchy. Word order in Hebrew is not free. It is functional — fronting an element signals focus, de-centering it cues background. The so-called “verbless clause” is not a lack — it is a form of theological restraint, where being is assumed rather than named.

Here, meaning begins before words become concepts. It begins when grammar itself starts to move. The syntax of Hebrew is not a code to be solved — it is a worldview being disclosed, line by line. And if we want to speak faithfully about what the text says, we must first attend to how it says anything at all.
