Not every echo in the text is a legitimate allusion. If we are to speak faithfully about meaning in the Hebrew Bible, we must ask: What makes a relationship between two texts real? Not all similarities are intentional. Not all parallel language carries rhetorical force.

So here I begin to lay out the parameters. Lexical correspondence matters — but it must occur within a larger structural resonance. The thematic context, narrative placement, and rhetorical function of the supposed allusion must contribute meaningfully to the flow of the receiving text. Otherwise, we risk substituting our interpretive imagination for the text’s actual logic.

This is where formation begins: by shaping interpretive discipline. I am not yet arguing for any specific allusions. I am refining the tools — building the scaffolding of trust that will hold the weight of textual meaning. Without this, interpretation becomes suggestion. But with this, Scripture begins to reveal the intentional design of its interwoven voice.
